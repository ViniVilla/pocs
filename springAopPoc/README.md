# Spring AOP
This is a proof of concept using the Aspect Oriented Programming from Spring.

It's a very simple planner project, with people and plans.

Spring AOP is used to make simple, but informative logs, logging the parameters and returns of endpoints annotated with @LogEndpoint
And the execution time of all methods inside the resource package.
